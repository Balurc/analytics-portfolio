# What is marketing campaign ?

In a general sense, a campaign is an organized effort to achieve a specific goal. This could be in various domains such as political, social, or commercial activities. 

In the marketing domain, a marketing campaign may refer a series of steps taken to promote a product through different mediums (TV, radio, print, online platforms) using various types of advertisements. 

And these campaigns/advertisements are designed to achieve a particular objective, such as increasing brand awareness, generating leads, boosting sales, or launching a new product.

Consider a simple example of an email marketing campaign aimed at increasing subscriptions for a streaming service. By using analytics, you can:

- Track Open and Click Rates: Measure how many recipients open the email and click on the subscription link.
